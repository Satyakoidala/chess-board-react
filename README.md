### Special Controls

-   **Timers**:
    -   Each player has a 10-minute timer
    -   Timer counts down during player's turn
    -   Timer pauses when it's opponent's turn

-   **Restart**:
    -   Reset the game to initial position
    -   Resets both timers to 10 minutes
    -   Clears any saved game state This project implements a complete chess game with timers, move validation, and a polished user interface.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The project is built using:

-   **React** for UI components
-   **Vite** for build tooling and development
-   **PropTypes** for component type checking
-   **CSS Modules** for styling

### Key Components

1. **App.jsx**: Main game container

    - Manages game state and configuration
    - Handles move validation and execution
    - Controls overall game flow
    - Manages local storage persistence

2. **Dashboard.jsx**: Game information display

    - Shows current player and status
    - Displays game status messages
    - Contains timer components
    - Shows captured pieces

3. **GameConfig.jsx**: Game setup interface

    - Player name configuration
    - Color selection interface
    - Timer duration settings
    - Initial game setup overlay

4. **Timer.jsx**: Player time management

    - Individual player timers
    - Visual state feedback
    - Low time warnings
    - Contrasting color schemes

5. **CountdownTimer.jsx**: Timer logic

    - Countdown functionality
    - Pause/resume handling
    - Timeout detection
    - Time format display

6. **useChessBoard.jsx**: Chess logic hook
    - Move validation and rules
    - Board state management
    - Check/checkmate detection
    - Game history tracking

### State Management

The game uses a sophisticated combination of React hooks and browser storage for state management:

#### Local Storage Keys

-   `chess-board-state`: Current board position and piece locations
-   `chess-timers-v1`: Timer values and states for both players
-   `chess-game-paused`: Game pause state
-   `chess-winner-v1`: Winner information if game is complete
-   `chess-game-config`: Player names and color preferences
-   `chess-move-history`: Record of previous moves (future feature)

#### React State Management

1. **Custom Hooks**

    - `useChessBoard`: Chess logic and board state management
    - Handles move validation, piece positions, and game rules
    - Manages check and checkmate detection

2. **React Hooks**

    - `useState`: UI state, timers, and game configuration
    - `useEffect`: Side effects and storage synchronization
    - `useRef`: DOM references and interval management
    - `useReducer`: Complex state transitions in chess logic

3. **Component State**
    - Piece positions and valid moves
    - Timer states and countdown logic
    - Player information and preferences
    - Game configuration and settings

#### Persistence Features

-   **Automatic Saving**:

    -   Board state after each move
    -   Timer values in real-time
    -   Player configuration and preferences
    -   Game state for pause/resume

-   **State Recovery**:
    -   Game resumes from last position on refresh
