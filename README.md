## Technical Details

### Architecture

The project is built using:

-   **React** for UI components
-   **Vite** for build tooling and development
-   **PropTypes** for component type checking
-   **CSS Modules** for styling

### Key Components

1. **App.jsx**: Main game container

    - Manages game state
    - Handles move validation
    - Controls game flow

2. **Dashboard.jsx**: Game information display

    - Shows current player
    - Displays game status
    - Contains timer components

3. **Timer.jsx**: Player time management

    - Individual player timers
    - Pause/resume functionality
    - Time format display

4. **useChessBoard.jsx**: Chess logic hook
    - Move validation
    - Board state management
    - Check/checkmate detection

### State Management

The game uses a combination of React hooks and localStorage for state management:

#### Local Storage Keys

-   `chess-board-state`: Current board position and piece locations
-   `chess-timers-v1`: Timer values for both players
-   `chess-game-paused`: Game pause state
-   `chess-winner-v1`: Winner information if game is complete

#### React State Hooks

-   `useChessBoard`: Custom hook for chess logic and board state
-   `useState`: For UI state management
-   `useEffect`: For side effects and localStorage synchronization

#### Persistence Features

-   Game state automatically saves after each move
-   Timers persist between page refreshes
-   Game can be resumed from last saved position
-   Manual reset available via Restart button

## Styling

The game features a modern, clean design with:

-   Responsive layout
-   Smooth animations
-   Clear move indicators
-   Status messages
-   Mobile-friendly interface

## Future Enhancements
